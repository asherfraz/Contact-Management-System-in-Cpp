# Contact Management System in C++

## Overview
Our project, the Contact Management System, is designed to manage contacts for businesses or other large-scale organizations. It helps users to save, search, and view contacts efficiently. By using Object-Oriented Programming principles and efficient data handling, this Contact Management System aims to streamline the process of managing contact information for organizations, ensuring ease of use and reliability.

## Features
- **Create New Contact**: Add new contacts with all required details.
- **Save Contact**: Save contact details to a text file.
- **Search Contact**: Find contacts by various parameters.
- **View List of Contacts**: Display all saved contacts.
- **Reset Contacts Book**: Clear all saved contacts.
- **Documentation**: Details about program and programmers.
- **One-Click Quit**: Exit the application with a single action.

## Requirements
The following details are managed in our project:
- First Name
- Last Name
- Country Code
- Phone Number
- Electronic Mail
- Address

## Implementation
We use Object-Oriented Programming with C++ to manipulate and store contacts efficiently. Contacts are stored in a text file.

### Methods and Structures
Our project utilizes the following programming concepts and structures:

- **If-Else Statements**: Conditional logic to manage different actions.
- **Switch Statements**: Multi-way branch statements to handle menu options.
- **Functions**: Modular code to perform specific tasks.
- **Classes**: Encapsulation of data and methods to represent contacts.
- **Data Encapsulation**: Keeping data safe from outside interference and misuse.
- **Inheritance**: Deriving new classes from existing ones to enhance functionality.
- **Friend Class**: Access control for classes.
- **Loops**: Iterative processing for handling multiple contacts.
- **File Handling**: Reading from and writing to text files to store contact information.
